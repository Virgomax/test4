//Mongodb Facts:
- The _id is random which eases scaling out (It's easy to get more database servers working at the same time)
- the four first bytes of _id are a timestamp
- the next three bytes are a machine identifier
- the next two bytes are a process id just to create a unique identifier
- the last three bytes are a counter
- you can overwrite the _id
